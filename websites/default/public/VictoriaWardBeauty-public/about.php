      <h2>About...</h2>
      <p>
        I have provided beauty treatments to private clients for a number of years, alongside 11 years' experience working and managing in leading spa venues across Warwickshire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to ongoing loyalty of existing customers and interest from new people, it has presented me with the opportunity to launch Victoria Ward Beauty Therapy.
      </p>​
      <p>
      I offer a wide range of treatments to a high standard, using the industries lead brands in a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. Whilst operating from home, I have converted a room where all treatments are delivered.
    </p>​I have a Spa Management Foundation Degree and completed both NVQ Level 2 and 3 in Beauty Therapy. I have also worked as a Spa Therapy lecturer at Warwickshire College.

      <p>
        If you have any questions about my treatments or would like to book please contact 07769872668, email victoriawardbeauty@gmail.com or alternatively send me a message via Facebook Victoria Ward Beauty Therapy.
